# publicsite

This website is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is available via the github sites link in the 'about' section. It contains some more information about my professional experience and is besides my resume and linkedin, and lets me get a feel for front end web development. It will be kept up to date and expanded into whatever I need in the future.
