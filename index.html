      <p>Hello, my name is Vetri Vijay and the beautiful photo above was taken at Michigan State University during the fall of 2021. 
      Currently I am a junior at MSU for my BS in Computer Science, with a focus on Machine Learning and AI. This website you are  
      looking at is coded in HTLM and CSS, and will be perpetually under development both in terms of design and content as I 
      improve my skills. All of my experiences are listed in chronological order, so you will find my most recent experienes at the bottom.
      Please feel free to reach out to me through the links at the top of the page.

      This portfolio is meant to expand upon my LinkedIn and resume. If that

      <p>My first experience in programming was on the FRC team 226 at Troy High School
        I gained experience programming in Java and utilizing the WPILib library to enable
        robot control. The robot is built from the ground up in 4 months and had induvidual
        teams in design, manufacturing and programming. As a result I learned how to communicate 
        with people from different aspects of a manufacturing process with varying levels of 
        understanding of what I do as a programmer. As my experience grew I specialized in PID
        control theory, which was crucial for precise movement in the autonomous mode and macros.

        <p>Stemming from my experience on an FRC team, I ofered a mentorship position on an FTC team,
          which is a middle school robotics team participating in a simpler version of FRC. This 
          was my first experience in a montor/teacher role, which will become a trend later on in my
          life. I passed my knowledge in programming and overal robot design to the students and
          coaches on this team, and helped them make their way to state competition as a rookie team

      <p>Alongside my technical experiences during high school, I was participating in Taekwondo
        and earned my first degree black belt after 3 years of rigorous training. Soon after I 
        took an oppertunity to be an assistant instructor which entails leading classes and teaching
        students. I gained experience in control of my mind and body as a martial artist, as well 
        as being a flexible teacher who can accommodate people at different skill levels, ages and 
        challenges in their training.

        <p>Right after my high school graduation and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic I began my
          first internship at DM3D Technologies as a software engineer. As my first experience in a 
          professional environment I gained plenty of experience in maintaining relations and 
          effective communication in the context of project specifications, timelines and expectations.
          My technical experience involved the use of software to manage the operations and data from
          Direct-Metal-Deposition 3D printers. Doing so involved the use of Visual Basic, LabView for
          visual interfaces and Microsoft SQL for data management and storage. One project involved 
          interacting with legacy codebases to add functionality. The projects included creating a
          post production part analysis tool with a visual feed, software and control panel for a 
          DAQ, and a data logger and report generation tool. These software solutions greatly
          increased improved productivity when testing the DMD printers, and created fundamental tools
          for newer printers. Every project also involved the appending or creation of a user manual,
          which required detailed descriptions of the tools itself, use cases, limitations and
          expandability.

      <p>After returning to in-person learning in the fall of 2021, I was enclined to join a team
        similar to my high school FRC team and further apply my skills in programming. I found this
        in the Michigan State University Solar Car Team, where in a similar fashion to FRC a car
        is developed for competitions. I was given a more hands on experience, as the car is built
        from the ground up with commercial parts, rather than the tailored FRC development proccess.
        All of my programming is done through Arduino Dues, which are used to manage numerious
        components of the car ranging from power distribution, motor control and exterior lighting.
        There are numerous boards and components such as an Orion 2 Battery Management System which
        communicate critical information using CAN communication protocol, which is extensively 
        used in the automotive world. Similar to FRC, the team consists of various subteams which I
        had to communicate with to program the Arduinos to specification. In the future I plan to
        modernize the team website with some more creative aspects.

      <p>After my first semester on campus I had the oppertunity to work as a Teaching Assistant for 
        CSE 232 after excelling in the class as a student. 232 is an introductory programming class 
        in C++, and the teaching assistants are responsible for offering office hours for students 
        to get help with their code, instructing lab sections and grading projects. My prior 
        experiences in teaching, communication and software engineering helped me fulfil this role 
        perfectly and offer students a productive learning environment for this class.

      <p>My most recent experience as been with Magna International as a Data Analyst Intern in the
        R&D team. My experience in software engineering and exposure the the automotive industry
        through MSU Solar has helped me learn difficult concepts in data science in my time here.
        I have explored concepts such as Edge Machine Learning for a proof-of-concepts for TinyML
        and various anomoly detection algorithms, both of which are for the manufacturing environment.
        The technologies I have used include Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow (Lite), Edge Impulse,
        statistical methods such as ReLU, FOMO, Autoencoders, k-NN, SVM and traditional statistical 
        tools like Z-scores. This internship definately placed me out of my comfort zone of pure
        software engineering, but using the internet and knowledge of my mentors/peers I was able
        to learn everything required to turn over software and machine learning models to complete
        the projects given to me.
